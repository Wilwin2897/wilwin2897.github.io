Recent experimental study revealed a new kind of plasmons in the Mott-insulating-like phase of thin film samples from SrNbO3+δ family. These unconventional plasmons have been attributed to the interplay between electron confinement due to extra oxygen planes and electronic correlations. Attempts to explain the phenomenon have also been proposed at the level of classical coupled- oscillators model and ab-initio calculations, giving rise to results that resemble the experimental optical and plasmonic spectra. In this letter, we propose a more microscopic and quantum mechan- ical approach to explain the occurrence of such correlated plasmons. Our calculations excellently reproduce the frequency-dependent behavior of the experimental optical and plasmonic spectra of both the metallic- and the Mott-insulating-like phases. Our results validate some previous findings and provide a deeper physical insight into the mechanism of unconventional plasmons generation.
