  The Directorate General of Higher Education organizes the National Olympiad of Mathematics and Natural Sciences in Higher Education (ON MIPA-PT) as part of preparing students in order to improve the nation’s competitiveness which was initiated in 2009 in Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics fields. Starting in 2011 the fields contested included Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. The competition was carried out in three stages namely Phase I at the college level which produced 7 best students in each field, Phase II at the regional level to determine the 50 best students and Phase III at the national level which produced 25 best students. 
* 2016: Tanoto Student Research Award 2016
  The Tanoto Student Research Award (TSRA) is an initiative of Tanoto Foundation in supporting young people to innovate through applied research in their respective campuses. TSRA has been running since 2007 in partnership with four universities: Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), University of North Sumatera (USU) and Hasanuddin University (Unhas). To date, Tanoto Foundation has supported 500 applied researches from the partner universities.
