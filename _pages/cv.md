Research experience
======
* University of Indonesia
  * Unconventional Plasmons Induced by Electron Confinement and Strong Coulomb Correlations in SrNbO3+δ family (link)
    * Recent experimental study revealed a new kind of plasmons in the Mott-insulating-like phase of thin film samples from SrNbO3+δ family. These unconventional plasmons have been attributed to the interplay between electron confinement due to extra oxygen planes and electronic correlations. Attempts to explain the phenomenon have also been proposed at the level of classical coupled- oscillators model and ab-initio calculations, giving rise to results that resemble the experimental optical and plasmonic spectra. In this letter, we propose a more microscopic and quantum mechanical approach to explain the occurrence of such correlated plasmons. Our calculations excellently reproduce the frequency-dependent behavior of the experimental optical and plasmonic spectra of both the metallic- and the Mott-insulating-like phases. Our results validate some previous findings and provide a deeper physical insight into the mechanism of unconventional plasmons generation.

Awards
======
* 2020-2022 : Postgraduate Studentship
* 2019: Best graduate in the Physics Department, ranked 2 in the Faculty of Science and Mathematics.
* 2018: Silver medal in  National Olympiad in Natural Sciences and Mathematics at University Level
  The Directorate General of Higher Education organizes the National Olympiad of Mathematics and Natural Sciences in Higher Education (ON MIPA-PT) as part of preparing students in order to improve the nation’s competitiveness which was initiated in 2009 in Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics fields. Starting in 2011 the fields contested included Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. The competition was carried out in three stages namely Phase I at the college level which produced 7 best students in each field, Phase II at the regional level to determine the 50 best students and Phase III at the national level which produced 25 best students. 
* 2016: Tanoto Student Research Award 2016
  The Tanoto Student Research Award (TSRA) is an initiative of Tanoto Foundation in supporting young people to innovate through applied research in their respective campuses. TSRA has been running since 2007 in partnership with four universities: Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), University of North Sumatera (USU) and Hasanuddin University (Unhas). To date, Tanoto Foundation has supported 500 applied researches from the partner universities.
